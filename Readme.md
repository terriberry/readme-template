# Name of the project
> Additional information or tagline

A brief description of your project, what it is used for and how does life get
awesome when someone starts to use it.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Modules used in this project

### Clean CQRS architecture

Clean architecture is a well-etablished API architecture that focusses on splitting up the API into separate layers that contain different purposes. These layers are as follows:
 - Domain Layer
 - Application Layer
 - Infrastructure Layer
 - UI/API Layer

Note that these layers have strict dependency rules working from the outside in. This means that the **domain layer is dependant on none of the others**, the **application layer only dependent on the domain layer** and finally **the infrastructure and UI/API layer dependant only on the application layer**

#### Domain Layer
The domain layer contains enterprise-wide logic and types including: 
 - Data Models (entities)
 - Value Objects
 - System-wide interfaces and utility classes
 - Some exceptions (eg. data specific exceptions)
 
#### Application Layer
The application layer contains all business logic and types as can be seen below:
 - Interfaces
 - Models
 - Logic
 - Commands/Queries
 - Validators
 - Exceptions
 - Behaviours
 - Mapping
 
#### Infrastrucutre Layer 
The infrastructure layer handles all external concerns such as: 
  - Persistence (data layer and ORMs)
  - Identity (or other auth providers)
  - File System
  - System Clock
  - External Gateways to API Clients
  - Cache
  - Migrations

#### UI/API Layer
This contains the interface of the application to the outside world. In this template, it consists of the Web API framework including controllers, middleware and startup amongst others.

### MediatR
Mediatr is a package that helps manage the flow of traffic in a manner that upholds the separation of concern principle and minimises dependencies. It simply uses handlers along with models to route traffic to the correct place. It also has built-in behaviours that can easily be attached before and/or after each request.

### Sentry

### Dependency Injection

### ASP.NET Core

The HTTP response status code are as follows:
- 400 Bad Request
- 401 Unauthorised
- 403 Forbidden Access
- 404 Not Found
- 500 Internal Server Error

Swagger is an automatic API documentation tool and here is the link:

### Fluent validation

### Entity Framework migrations

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really randy, you can even do this

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

#### Argument 1
Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
- Related projects:
  - Your other project: https://github.com/your/other-project/
  - Someone else's project: https://github.com/someones/awesome-project/


## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
